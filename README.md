# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration
## by Mary Etokwudo


## Dataset

This dataset includes information about 183,412 individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area, in the month of February 2019. The main focus is on the duration of the rides and understanding how other features like rider's age and gender relates to the duration. The dataset can be found in [the repository fo bike share data systems](https://github.com/BetaNYC/Bike-Share-Data-Best-Practices/wiki/Bike-Share-Data-Systems)


## Summary of Findings

The following is a summary of my findings:

* Most of the rides lasted between 200 to 600 seconds.
* Most rides are by the male gender.
* The dataset has more rides by younger people than older people.
* Most riders are subscribers.
* Saturdays and Sundays have the least number of rides.
* Of all the features I compared to ride duration, none of them affects the ride duration. This may be because the company has a duration range they allow for riders. It may also be that people generally have a limit to how long they can ride a bike before switching to other means of transportation. For instance, taking a bike from the office to the train or bus station. 
already observed that most riders do not use the bikes for all their trips.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on how other features affect the duration of the rides. This is shown in the visualisations on the following: 

* The relationship between ride duration and age group of riders
* The relationship between ride duration, age and gender of riders

Of all the features compared to ride duration, none of them affects the ride duration. This may be because the company has a duration range they allow for riders. It may also be that people generally have a limit to how long they can ride a bike before switching to other means of transportation. For instance, taking a bike from the office to the train or bus station. The next two visualisations show that most riders do not use the bikes for all their trips, also that most of them are subscribers.
